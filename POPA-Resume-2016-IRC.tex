%\section{SENIOR HONORS THESIS}
\section{OBJECTIVE}
I would like to assist the International Rescue Committee of Sacramento wherever I am most needed. Based on my skills and the amount of time I can allot (4 hours per week), I think I am most suited to help with computer literacy or ESL tutoring. However I would be happy to chat with someone from the IRC about where I could be of most assistance!
